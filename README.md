## Use

It's simple, if you want to add a new group, copy and paste the old one, and replace the Steam group, and Rocket permission group. <br>

To get your Steam group ID64, just get the link to your group, e.g.: `https://steamcommunity.com/groups/imperialplugins`
and add `/memberslistxml/?xml=1` to the end of it: `https://steamcommunity.com/groups/imperialplugins/memberslistxml/?xml=1`
and it will display it near the top: `<groupID64>103582791457933883</groupID64>`
